With the Steam Deck coming out I find myself wanting to replay some of the Wii U classics (BoTW anyone?). While I donâ€™t condone the use of ROM dump websites, I do understand why one might use them. I will not be going over the ROM dumping process from the Wii U in this post but may cover it in the future.

Once a ROM has been dumped from the Wii U it is still encrypted and needs to be decrypted before the game can be played with an emulator.

Downloads:
 - [cdecrypt](https://github.com/VitaSmith/cdecrypt/releases)
 - [Cemu](https://cemu.info)

 1. Extract cdecrypt archive. 
 2. Create a file `keys.txt` in the same folder as cdecrypt.exe.
 3. Locate a common Wii U key online and paste it into the first line of `keys.txt`. Optionally, find a Wii U common dev key and paste it into the second line of `keys.txt`.
 4. Run `cdecrypt.exe <input folder> <output folder>`to decrypt the game. 
 5. Add the newly decrypted game to cemu.
 6. Optional: explore graphics packs in cemu.
